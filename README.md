## VR Lab: Lab 1

In this lab, my objective of this lab was to create an experience where the player had to explore the small farm and look for the animals to be put back into their shed. They will see that the animals are hidden, and the player needs to look by reaching into trees, or haystacks and pulling out whatever is in there. It can be doors, a car, another haystack or the proper animal that is lost and be put back to the herd that the animal feel most comfortable at. The animals that I used was picked up in the asset store that was free to use and low poly to fit the overall theme of the environment, and that used the same light color theory that the farm was using However, I ran into many issues in the project, and wasn't able to complete it fully because the issue was that when you walk to the objective, the whole screen goes black, while in the scene view, it shows the player in its normal position as well with the camera. There is a bug in the game that I couldn't identify.
