## AR Lab: Lab 2

This lab was extremely fun to play around with. However, with developing its not always about fun and it provides me a lot of ideas of what you can do in AR. AR is not only for gaming, but it can used for so much more, like design, education and business. In this one, I imported a car to give it a feel that with this technology we can develop cars in the computers and except prototyping cars or doing 2d art, we can visually see the potential size of the car in all its glory. Not only can it be used for the car industry but in almost every type of business, be able to see a new marketing board, a new spaceship, new weapons for the military and so on the possibilities are endless.
